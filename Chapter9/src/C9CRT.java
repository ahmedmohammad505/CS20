		1. The index value in the third element is 2

		4. for (int grades: grades){

		5a. 
		Step 1) create a copy of the first array
		Step 2) have the index values that are greater than or equal to the new data be increased by 1
		Step 3) copy the new data to the second array
		Step 4) copy the second array back in the original array
		
        6. Passing a single element: passes by value, you can modify a copy of the element
        passing entire array: passes by a reference pointer, you can modify the elements in memory
